## What is it

XS2ASandbox is a dynamic sandbox environment: you can create users, payments as well as consents, and play with data for testing purposes. With the dynamic sandbox [TPP UI](https://github.com/adorsys/XS2A-Sandbox/tree/master/tpp-ui), you can access banking APIs directly, get TPP certificates and manage testing accounts.

[Developer Portal](https://github.com/adorsys/XS2A-Sandbox/tree/master/developer-portal-ui) contains testing instructions and all of the necessary documentation. All PSD2 services can be installed and run with one simple command. 

Two main SCA approaches are supported: REDIRECT and EMBEDDED. For the Redirect SCA Approach an [Online Banking UI](https://github.com/adorsys/XS2A-Sandbox/tree/master/oba-ui) is used for authorisation.
