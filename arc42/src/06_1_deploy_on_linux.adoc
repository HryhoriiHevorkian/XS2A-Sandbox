# XS2ASandbox

Implementation of the dynamic sandbox based on the adorsys ledgers core banking system and XS2A services.

## Running the XS2ASandbox

0.For build and run XS2ASandbox requires GNU Make to be installed on your local machine. Please, make sure it is installed.

1.Download the project and go to the project directory:

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/adorsys/XS2A-Sandbox
> cd XS2A-Sandbox
```

2.This sandbox runs with the docker-compose that can be found at:  [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [Makefile](Makefile).
But before you run this, first of all you should check if all build dependencies are installed:

```sh
> make check
```

If something is missing, install it to your local machine, otherwise the build will fail. 
List of dependencies that are required to use XS2ASandbox: **Java 8**, **nodeJs**, **AngularCLI**, **asciidoctor**, **jq**, **docker**, **docker-compose**, **maven**, **plantuml**.
Here are links where you can install needed dependencies:

| Dependency         | Link                                    |                                                     
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Java 8             | https://openjdk.java.net/install/       | 
| Node.js 11.x       | https://nodejs.org/en/download          | 
| Angular CLI 7.x    | https://angular.io/guide/quickstart     |                                                                                                        
| Asciidoctor 2.0    | https://asciidoctor.org                 |
| jq 1.6             | https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download  |
| NGINX 1.15.5       | http://nginx.org/download/              |
| PostgreSQL         | https://docs.docker.com/compose/install |
| Maven    3.5       | https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi   |
| PlantUML 1.2019.3  | http://plantuml.com/en/starting         |


**Note 1**: please, use **Node.js** version lower than **12** (e.g. **10.x.x** or **11.x.x**). Otherwise angular applications would not be built due to
version conflicts.

**Note 2**: check amount of memory given to **Docker** (Open Docker Desktop -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Memory).
For a fast and painless start of all the services it should be not less than 5 GB.

3.Build and run the project with Makefile:
  
```sh 
> make all
```
